/*ID's are metioned by (#) while class's are mentioned by (.)
Here ID's are unique and can only be used once.
But Class's are common and can be used multiple times*/

/* There are 4 kinds of selectors in CSS
ID which are called by #id and these are unique and can only be used once.
Tag like h1, p etc, which we can call every time.
Class can be called by .class and they are common and can be used as much as we want.
We can also use group selectors like, `h1, p, .class, #id, etc...`

There are also 2 type of combinator like,
descendent: `li p` means p tags under/inside li, or p tags that are descendent of li, seperated with space
child: `h2 > p` means p tags as the direct child of h2, or p tags directly under/ inside of h2, seperated with a > sign. */
